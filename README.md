This is a menu evaluator. 

It reads a text file, which has a target price at the top followed by lines of menu items (description and price),
then outputs all combinations of menu items that add up to that target price, in a readable format that you could
easily tell or show to the waiter. 

To use this program, type the following below at the command line, where FILENAME.txt is replaced by the actual name of
the text file with your menu:

ruby menu_evaluator.rb FILENAME.txt

If there is no combination of menu items that add up to your target, the program will tell you so.
